This is a program that reads a txt file of a book and analyze the number of
unique words in a text file. 

The program takes two argument, first one is the pathname of the text, second
is the integer number of the cut off point for the list of words outputed 

example for running this script:

    $ python stemcompare.py pride_and_prejudice.txt 30

assume that you have pride_and_prejudice.txt in your current directory

This program first compare words in the file without stemming, with snowball
stemming, and with lancaster stemming

It then try to filter out the stopwords from the list of words then repeat 
the stemming process again. 

With these output, user can get a more direct understanding of the text and
how the different types of stemming algorithms affect the output of analyzing
texts.
